# OOP Pong Game

A modern twist on the classic Pong game implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python with Pygame. Features dynamic ball mechanics, powerups, and competitive gameplay!


## Features

- **OOP Design**: Clean, modular code structure with classes for game objects (paddles, ball, powerups).
- **Classic Controls**:
  - **Player 1**: `W` (up) and `S` (down).
  - **Player 2**: `↑` (up) and `↓` (down).
- **Random Ball Trajectory**: The ball spawns randomly when hit by a paddle for unpredictable gameplay.
- **Powerups**: 
  - Purple squares spawn randomly after the paddle hits.
  - Collect to **enlarge your paddle*!
- **Simple Graphics**: Built with Pygame for smooth 2D rendering.
